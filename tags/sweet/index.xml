Cut butter into Â½ inch cubes, then set aside in the freezer to keep cold. Meanwhile prepare the rest of the ingredients. Weigh the flour and set aside in the freezer or fridge as well. The colder the ingredients, the better. Grind walnuts very finely with a mouli grater (I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find walnut meal). Don&amp;rsquo;t use a food processor, the chopped pieces will still come out too big.</description></item><item><title>Easy strawberry ice cream</title><link>https://mipmip.github.io/summer-qremix/recipe/strawberry-ice-cream/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mipmip.github.io/summer-qremix/recipe/strawberry-ice-cream/</guid><description>Children aged 3-6 can enjoy getting stuck in to making and eating this summery treat. Add your own toppings for extra fun.
Pull the green hulls out of the strawberries. If they are still quite hard, cut them in half or quarters with a table knife. Tip them into a flat-bottomed dish. Use a potato masher to squash the strawberries as much as you can. Tip into a bowl. Ask your grown-up helper to give you a hand if you need to.</description></item><item><title>Gin &amp; tonic ice lollies</title><link>https://mipmip.github.io/summer-qremix/recipe/gin-tonic-popsicle/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mipmip.github.io/summer-qremix/recipe/gin-tonic-popsicle/</guid><description>For a twist on gin &amp;amp; tonic, try these alcoholic ice lollies as a boozy grown-up treat for hot summer days. They&amp;rsquo;ll keep in the freezer for up to two months.
Take a six-hole lolly mould and push a cucumber slice and a mint leaf into each one. In a jug, stir the gin, tonic and sugar until the sugar dissolves and the tonic loses its fizz. Divide between the moulds, push in the lolly sticks and freeze for at least 4 hrs, or preferably overnight.</description></item></channel></rss>
