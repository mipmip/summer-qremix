Cut butter into ½ inch cubes, then set aside in the freezer to keep cold. Meanwhile prepare the rest of the ingredients. Weigh the flour and set aside in the freezer or fridge as well. The colder the ingredients, the better. Grind walnuts very finely with a mouli grater (I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find walnut meal). Don&amp;rsquo;t use a food processor, the chopped pieces will still come out too big.</description></item><item><title>Cauliflower steaks with roasted red pepper &amp; olive salsa</title><link>https://mipmip.github.io/summer-qremix/recipe/cauliflower-steaks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mipmip.github.io/summer-qremix/recipe/cauliflower-steaks/</guid><description>Unlock the flavours of cauliflower with a red pepper, olive and caper salsa, topped with almonds. Healthy and vegan, it makes a tasty light lunch or supper.
Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 and line a baking tray with baking parchment. Slice the cauliflower into two 1-inch steaks – use the middle part as it’s larger, and save the rest for another time. Rub the paprika and 1⁄2 tbsp oil over the steaks and season.</description></item><item><title>Easy strawberry ice cream</title><link>https://mipmip.github.io/summer-qremix/recipe/strawberry-ice-cream/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mipmip.github.io/summer-qremix/recipe/strawberry-ice-cream/</guid><description>Children aged 3-6 can enjoy getting stuck in to making and eating this summery treat. Add your own toppings for extra fun.
Pull the green hulls out of the strawberries. If they are still quite hard, cut them in half or quarters with a table knife. Tip them into a flat-bottomed dish. Use a potato masher to squash the strawberries as much as you can. Tip into a bowl. Ask your grown-up helper to give you a hand if you need to.</description></item><item><title>Gin &amp; tonic ice lollies</title><link>https://mipmip.github.io/summer-qremix/recipe/gin-tonic-popsicle/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mipmip.github.io/summer-qremix/recipe/gin-tonic-popsicle/</guid><description>For a twist on gin &amp;amp; tonic, try these alcoholic ice lollies as a boozy grown-up treat for hot summer days. They&amp;rsquo;ll keep in the freezer for up to two months.
Take a six-hole lolly mould and push a cucumber slice and a mint leaf into each one. In a jug, stir the gin, tonic and sugar until the sugar dissolves and the tonic loses its fizz. Divide between the moulds, push in the lolly sticks and freeze for at least 4 hrs, or preferably overnight.</description></item><item><title>Griddled halloumi with watermelon &amp; caper breadcrumbs</title><link>https://mipmip.github.io/summer-qremix/recipe/halloumi-watermelon-breadcrumbs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mipmip.github.io/summer-qremix/recipe/halloumi-watermelon-breadcrumbs/</guid><description>This salad has a great interplay of textures, temperatures and flavours. Toss juicy watermelon with salty cheese, crispy breadcrumbs, capers, almonds and mint.
Cut the watermelon into either cubes or slices and transfer to a bowl with the very finely sliced shallots. Add 4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil and the balsamic, then season with fresh black pepper. Cover and put in the fridge for about 15-20 mins. Heat the remaining oil in a frying pan.</description></item><item><title>Lime, physalis and elderflower caipiroska</title><link>https://mipmip.github.io/summer-qremix/recipe/physalis-caipiroska/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mipmip.github.io/summer-qremix/recipe/physalis-caipiroska/</guid><description>Lime, Physalis and Elderflower Caipiroska

Season with salt and pepper; mix well to combine. Form into a 3/4-inch-thick patty, transfer to a plate, and refrigerate 10 minutes.</description></item></channel></rss>
